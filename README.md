# Play with Spurious Correlations

This project explores various methods with spurious correlations, using a custom dataset that combines CIFAR-10 with embedded MNIST.

## Project Overview

We investigate how neural networks handle spurious correlations in image data.

## Custom Dataset: CIFAR-10 with Embedded MNIST

We engineered a novel dataset by embedding MNIST into the corners of CIFAR-10 images, creating a controlled environment to investigate spurious correlations.
